# Android Apps
This repository contains several applications I've created during Mobile Systems course at Bialystok University of Technology. 

**Quiz App** - a basic quiz application which introduced me to creating applications in Android Studio. It contains several questions with true/false and the next question buttons. The second version of this app has been extended to display answers (hints) and support screen rotation (saving and restoring the current state when activity is destroyed).

**ToDo App** - this app consists of elements intended for creating user interfaces such as fragments, lists and adapters. The second version of this app uses an options menu (displaying number of active tasks), marking task as done, translations and a better layout: icons and Material Design color scheme.

**Sensors App** - a simple app listing all the sensors built in user's device, showing the monitored values of some sensors and returns the user's current location. To show user's current location appriopriate permissions are required. 

**Library App SQL** - a simple app which introduced me to handling with the local SQLite database. It allows you to add, delete and edit information about books.

**Library App API** - an application with Retrofit2 HTTP client implementation to support Open Library REST API. It allows you to search some information about a specific book which name you can type in search bar. An image loading is implemented by Picasso library.

**Shopping App** - more advanced app which main purpose is creating shopping lists. This application allows you to prepare a list of products to buy with photos, find nearest shops on Google Maps and mark favorite shops. It supports Google Firebase authentication and notification systems. You can secure an access to app with your fingerprint. Shopping App has a nice UI, and it supports dark theme. It consists of activites and fragments.
